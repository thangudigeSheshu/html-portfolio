        <h2> (2) What is Dream Flights's policy if a flight is cancelled, delayed or preponed?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dream Flights reserves the right to cancel, reschedule, or delay the commencement or continuance of a flight or to alter the stopping place or deviate from the route of the journey without incurring any liability in damages or otherwise to the Customers or any other person whatsoever.

In case of delays of more than 2 hours or Preponement of the flight by more than 1 hour, customers are entitled to a full refund or re-booking onto an alternative Dream Flights flight at no additional cost subject to availability. In the special case in which a subsequent portion of a Dream Flights flight is cancelled while a Customer is already in transit, a Customer shall have the right to choose to remain at the transit station and accept a partial refund for the portion of the flight not completed; or to return to the point of origin and receive a refund; or a credit for future travel on Dream Flights; or re-booking onto an alternative Dream Flights flight at no additional cost subject to availability. Any compensation arising out of cancellation or delay of flights will be processed as per DGCA guideline outlined in Civil Aviation Requirement, Section - 3, Series M Part IV. Passengers who have not provided valid contact information at the time of flight booking may not be entitled to any compensation.</li>

                <li>In case of a delay or cancellation of the connecting flight at the point of transit, Dream Flights will, at its discretion and subject to availability of seats, first offer the passenger the option to travel on the next Dream Flights flight, or that of another airline.
